# The WowWee JoeBot

The WowWee JoeBot is a humanoid robot that can walk, talk, sing and shoot. It
makes cheeky remarks and it can play simple games. But you can't program it
and there doesn't seem to be a hack for it (yet) either.

## Features

  * Joebot has preprogrammed voice commands.
  * His hands function as buttons to invoke dancing, walking or singing behaviour.
  * He can also play back beats that you just played for him.
  * When walking, he can avoid obstacles.
  * By setting joebot in different poses you can program a dance.

Overall Joebot is unable to hold your attention for longer than half an hour.
Even as a kids toy it is rather boring. The possibilities to create something
or to use your own imagination are extremely limited.
