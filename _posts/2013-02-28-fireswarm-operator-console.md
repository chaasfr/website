# FireSwarm operator console

The UAV operator console for the fire drones in the FireSwarm project
(<http://www.fireswarm.nl>) is created using node.js, of which the code can be
found on [github](https://github.com/mrquincle/uav-console).

This software is in an alpha-stage, but it demonstrates the power of node.js
and the community behind it. The convenience of the node package manager, npm,
is unprecedented (although, it is of course similar to apt-get, and package
managers that exists for distros).
