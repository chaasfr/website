# Introduction to One-Class Support Vector Machine

Traditionally, many classification problems try to solve the two or multi-
class situation. The goal of the machine learning application is to
distinguish test data between a number of classes, using training data. But
what if you only have data of one class and the goal is to test new data and
found out whether it is alike or not like the training data? A method for this
task, which gained much popularity the last two decades, is the One-Class
Support Vector Machine. This (quite lengthly) blog post will give an
introduction to this technique and will show the two main approaches.

At [this blog](http://rvlasveld.github.io/blog/2013/07/12/introduction-to-one-class-support-vector-machines/) the post continues.
