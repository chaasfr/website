# Dodedodo Christmas lights 

Lately, we've been busy trying to develop a way for us to easily interact
between devices in a modular way. This resulted in Dodedodo.

Dodedodo allows anyone to install modules on different devices and easily
connect them by using the Dodedodo website. Just create an account at [dodedodo.com](http://www.dodedodo.com).

As a test, we had our christmas tree display messages from an android phone in
morse code. Another phone stood ready to decipher the message. Check the video
below to see how this works.
