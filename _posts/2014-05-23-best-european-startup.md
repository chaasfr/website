# The Robot Launch competition

It are exciting times for us at DoBots. We are very proud to be part of the six finalists of the [Robot Launch competition](http://robotlaunch.com/) out of competition with 60 other startups in robotics. Movies from the finalists can be found at [Robot Launch](http://robotlaunch.com/2014/05/robot-launch-2014-finalists-announced/). The finalists:

 * [RoboSoft Systems](http://www.robosoftsystems.co.in/), a duct inspection robot
 * [Tandemech Engineering](http://www.tandemech.com/), a wall-climbing robot
 * [Leka](http://weareleka.com/en/), a robotic interactive sphere as a toy, made for children with autism
 * [DoBots](http://dobots.nl), <strong>yes, us</strong>, an autopilot for an industrial scrubber/dryer robot
 * [Odd I/O](http://www.oddiopdx.com/), an interactive robot reacting on music and sounds
 * [Robotics Technologies of Tennessee](http://www.robotictechtn.com/), mobile platforms for welding and inspection in the shipbuilding industry

We are happy we were in such good company, but of course, it makes the competition fierce!

## Competition

A rich panel of judges assembled by Andra Keay from [RoboHub](http://robohub.org/author/andrakeay/) formed a balanced view on the pros and cons of the different robotic technologies presented. There is Glenn Luinenburg, partner at WilmerHale law firm, Rich Mahoney, director of Robotics at SRI International, Roger Chen	from OATV, Cyril Ebersweiler from Haxlr8r, Kate Drane, the hardware lead at Indiegogo, and Shahin Farshchi from Lux Capital.

You can see the entire Google Hangout, including technical glitches on YouTube:

However, our presentation can not be seen in this Hangout, so to save one hour and a half of your life, this is a short presentation (of 4 minutes) with a voice over:

If you are impatient, forward to 3:15. Here two clips start with moving robots (and Bart).

## Future 

Future editions of this competitions might lead to questions to us. Feel free to ask us. We also suggested a Google+ community around it, which can be [found](https://plus.google.com/u/1/communities/113625439039934216202). Ask to be a member if you want to come in contact with other startups in robotics.

Very important, in case you are considering investing in robotics, please, [contact us](about-us.html)! We are down to earth, and make products and services that really are of added value to consumers or businesses. The industrial cleaning robot will be there in the near future. This is no science fiction anymore.
