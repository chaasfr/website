				<h2>Crownstone</h2>
				<p>
				<strong>Smart</strong> buildings is both, observation and control: "See & Do". Although this becomes more mainstream, DoBots has been accelerating this research by developing the <strong>Crownstone</strong>. 
				</p>
				<p>
				The Crownstone is a Bluetooth Low-Energy switching block that can be embedded everywhere in a building. Not only can people use their smartphones to control every wire in the building, but also the building knows where the people are. This means:
				<ul>
					<li>An audiotour through a museum adjusted to your preferences</li>
					<li>Directing people to the right track on a railway station</li>
					<li>An alarm service in a daycare center or hospital</li>
					<li>An office that shuts down all devices (except for fridges, etc.) at night</li>
				</ul>
				The combination of observation and control allows for services that satisfy both facility managers as well as end-users!

				<h2>A sneak preview</h2>
				<p>
				An early version of the Crownstone. It uses Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) which is currently supported by many smartphones. It allows people to opt-in for services provided at the location at hand. No secretive tracking!

			<h2>Smart Offices</h2>
			<p>
			A smart office (a bank, a courthouse, a helpdesk), knows how to treat her employees well. 
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-md-3 col-xs-6">
				<div class="center">
					<h3>Energy savings</h3>
					<p>The entire building goes in sleep mode when everybody leaves. It's not just standby for a few devices such as screens and printers. However, this cannot be done without knowing which devices are in the building. A fridge cannot be turned off. The Crownstone can measure energy profiles of devices it is attached to and self-configure the network in a really smart way for energy efficiency purposes.
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="col-md-3 col-xs-6">
				<div class="center">
					<h3>People awareness</h3>
					<p>A lot of HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) systems do not consider occupancy levels. Even less is the presence of people used for other purposes. To know if your colleagues is a meeting room, you'll have to go there and check it for yourself. Especially in bigger buildings, people quickly lose track of each other, reducing work efficiency. Also, an innovative work environment, such as a flexible floorplan becomes almost impossible to implement. 
					</p>
				</div>

			<div class="col-md-3 col-xs-6">
				<div class="center">
					<h3>Communication</h3>
					<p>
					A smart office fosters communication between people residing in it. If a new person enters a building, an introduction mediated through the building infrastructure is not such a bad idea. The building can reserve a meeting room for participants, why would a participant be worrying about it!?

			<h2>Smart Buildings for the Elderly</h2>
			<p>
			Building automation and home automation are far-fetched for a random elderly person.
			</p>

		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-md-3 col-xs-6">
				<div class="center">
					<h3>Alarm</h3>
					<p>
					An alarm button is a comforting thought. However, there are many more technological possibilities. To detect a fall, a noise meter would be efficient. Moreover, the alarm does not always need to call an emergence crew, but can gradually escalate. First, the older person is called, if necessary, a neighbour is called, then a caretaker, etc. in a logical order. 
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="col-md-3 col-xs-6">
				<div class="center">
					<h3>Passive sensing</h3>
					<p>
					An alarm button is not enough. An accident might happen with the alarm button is far away, or a person might get unconscious. Incorporating cameras is too intrusive, however, by just including a few sensors here and there: a door sensor, a bed or chair sensor (Dutch: "belmatje"), a movement detection sensor, so-called anomalies in the "activities of daily life" can be detected. Maximum comfort and minimum intrusiveness!
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="col-md-3 col-xs-6">
				<div class="center">
					<h3>Lights and devices</h3>
					<p>
					Most fire accidents with elderly happen with devices used incorrectly. The Crownstone detects power consumption and shuts off a device immediately. Warning someone is an easy next step. Control of lights at night is important as well. Many people fall due to the fact that it is dark at night. Automating lights are not just comfort anymore, they become life savers!

			<h2>Smart Museums</h2>
			<p>
			Interaction with visitors is especially important in museums and other buildings that tailor a (semi-)public service. 
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-md-3 col-xs-6">
				<div class="center">
					<h3>Audiotour</h3>
					<p>
					An audiotour entirely personalized towards the visitor's taste. A localised message per painting is no problem using the Crownstone. A visitor can perhaps even interact with an installation adjusting lights. A photo with flash is often prohibited in a museum, but buying a copy at that spot might be a nice alternative!
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-3 col-xs-6">
				<div class="center">
					<h3>Popularity and People Density</h3>
					<p>
					Which art works are visited most by people? What can be changed in rooms? Also exchange programs between museums can use this information. Security personnel can also benefit from knowing where most people reside in the building.
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-3 col-xs-6">
				<div class="center">
					<h3>Air quality</h3>
					<p>
					The facility manager can benefit tremendously from a building with Crownstones. By adding Bluetooth sensors for humidity and temperature it is easy to monitor the air quality for the paintings. Moreover, these considerations can be seamlessly integrated with the knowledge on people density. A smart museum takes care of its customers as well as its art works!
