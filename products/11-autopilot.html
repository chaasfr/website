				<h2>Navigation Autopilot</h2>
				<p>
				<strong>Smart</strong> robots, are robots that can work in environments that were hitherto restricted to humans. Robots enter slowly the domestic part of the cleaning market, however, the professional cleaning industry, doesn't yet have the big brothers of the Roomba and the Scooba in operation. 
				</p>
				<p>
				DoBots identified two key factors that allow robots to take over the market of professional floor cleaning. First, thanks to advances in the entertainment industry, the prices for 3D depth sensors dropped from a steep price range of €&nbsp;15.000,- to a stunning €&nbsp;150,- (Kinect). Second, the problem of a cleaning robot is not a hardware problem, it is a software problem. Algorithms for autonomous navigation matured considerably in the last few years. 
				</p>	
				<p>
				Our offering: 
				<ul>
					<li>an autopilot below a €&nbsp;1000,- transforming your cleaning machine into a robot. </li>
				</ul>

			<h2>Service</h2>
			<p>
			There are many benefits for using robots in the floor cleaning industry.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-md-3 col-xs-6">
				<div class="center">
					<h3>Costs</h3>
					<p>
					DoBots provides it services through a service contract of €&nbsp;100,- per <strong>month</strong>. The autopilot adds €&nbsp;1000,- to the cleaning machine. Compare this with €&nbsp;20,- per <strong>hour</strong> for a cleaning person. Saving only one cleaning hour per day, amounts to saving €&nbsp;660,- per month.
					</p>
				</div>

			<div class="col-md-3 col-xs-6">
				<div class="center">
					<h3>Personnel diversification</h3>
					<p>
					DoBots wants to create services that work for and with people. Diversification of personnel: allows the creation of professional ladders (certificates), more diverse offerings to customers, and enriches interactions between colleagues. Cleaning activities should be fun: robots get the boring parts, controlling a robot empowers. 
					</p>

					<h3>Always the best</h3>
					<p>
					Currently there is a mis-alignment between the user and the manufacturer of a cleaning machine. The user wants a clean floor, but pays for a machine. By paying a service fee, the cleaning company becomes responsible for the machine, takes care of it, and upgrades it continuously with the newest brushes, batteries, and sweeping strategies.

			<h2>Functionality</h2>
			<p>
			The autopilot has navigation, localization, and sweeping functionality.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-md-3 col-xs-6">
				<div class="center">
					<h3>Navigation</h3>
					<p>
					A map can be uploaded to the robot, or the robot can autonomously chart an area. Changes in the environment, such as containers, products, or people are incorporated automatically.
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="col-md-3 col-xs-6">
				<div class="center">
					<h3>Localization</h3>
					<p>
					A robot always knows where it is. There will be no lost equipment. An anti-theft alarm system is included. In manual operation or with remote operation, the localization of the robot can be tracked as well.
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="col-md-3 col-xs-6">
				<div class="center">
					<h3>Sweeping</h3>
					<p>
					The scrubber/dryer sweeps according to a self-created plan given the area to maintain. This can also be manually overridden by the end user in a friendly graphical interface.
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<h2>Status</h2>
			<p>
			Status of the device and the environment are easily monitored.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-md-3 col-xs-6">
				<div class="center">
					<h3>Battery</h3>
					<p>
					The autopilot knows the state of the batteries. Thanks to its localization capabilities it can find a recharge station. Deep discharging will be prevented automatically by communication to the maintenance team. The lifetime of the robot is greatly enhanced by monitoring for required maintenance.
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="col-md-3 col-xs-6">
				<div class="center">
					<h3>Coverage</h3>
					<p>
					The robot knows where it went. The state of the floor can be directly reported, and truthfully so. Different from a human, a robot can operate in a 24-hour setting, in "performance-based" settings.
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="col-md-3 col-xs-6">
				<div class="center">
					<h3>Water and soap</h3>
					<p>
					The level of water and soap are easily displayed to a cleaning person. In robotizing the mechanics of the cleaning machine it is also possible to refill automatically.
					</p>
